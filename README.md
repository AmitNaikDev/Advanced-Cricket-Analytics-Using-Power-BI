## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

**Advanced Cricket Analytics Using Power BI** is designed to analyze and visualize cricket data with advanced business intelligence techniques. The project involves:

- Cleaning and shaping raw cricket datasets
- Designing a semantic data model for analysis
- Writing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom metrics
- Creating interactive reports for various stakeholder perspectives

The goal is to derive meaningful patterns and performance trends that go beyond just runs and wickets â€” offering insights into team strategies, player efficiency, match-winning factors, and historical comparisons.

## ðŸ“˜ What Youâ€™ll Find in This Project

### 1. **Power BI Report File (`.pbix`)**

This is the heart of the project. The `.pbix` file includes:

- A complete data model
- All necessary DAX measures and calculated columns
- Multiple report pages with slicers, tables, charts, and filters

### 2. **Datasets**

Contains the raw cricket match and player data, typically structured in Excel or CSV format. These may include:

- Match summaries
- Player performance stats (batting and bowling)
- Team vs. team results
- Toss decisions and venue details

### 3. **Power Query Transformations**

The data undergoes extensive cleaning and transformation using Power Query. This includes:

- Renaming and restructuring columns
- Removing null or invalid entries
- Creating lookup tables (teams, venues, players)
- Data type conversions and relationship building

The Power BI dashboard presents several key insights using filters, slicers, and summary visuals:

### **1. Match Overview**
- Total runs scored by each team
- Wickets taken
- Overs played
- Match winner and result margin

### **2. Team Performance**
- Total matches played, won, and lost
- Win percentage for each team
- Toss result and toss decision breakdown

### **3. Player Statistics**
- Batting: total runs, strike rate, boundaries
- Bowling: wickets taken, overs bowled, economy

### **4. Venue Insights**
- Number of matches played per venue
- Win/loss stats per team at each venue

### **5. Filtering Options**
- Filter the visuals by:
  - Match
  - Team
  - Player
